                <p class="intro"><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H" target="_blank"><span class="dc">H</span></a>i there! My name is Leon Jiang. I'm from a small city in sunny southern California called <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrance,_California" target="_blank">Torrance</a>. At home, I enjoy going to the beach to bike, run, and hang out with friends. Here in Providence, Rhode Island, good beaches are scarce and far, and the sun <a class="link" href="https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/1976561-is-the-weather-depressing-at-east-coast-schools.html" target="_blank">doesn't always show itself</a>. As a result, I've been spending more time playing table tennis, taking photos, practicing piano, and going on excursions with <a class="link" href="https://brownoutingclub.com/" target="_blank">BOC</a>. I've also recently begun dabbling in art&mdash;so be on the lookout next time you're at <a class="link" href="https://www.moma.org/" target="_blank">MoMA</a> or the <a class="link" href="https://www.louvre.fr/en" target="_blank">Louvre</a> &#128521</p>
